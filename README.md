## üìò Usage Guide

This section provides details on how to interact with the `MissalCalculation` class to retrieve and configure daily liturgical readings.

### ‚úÖ Installation

If you're using this as a Git-based package in Flutter:

```yaml
dependencies:
  missal_calculator:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/your-username/missal_calculator.git
```

### üõ† Constructor

```dart
final missal = MissalCalculation(
  dateTime: DateTime(2024, 12, 1),
  countryCode: "ng", // optional, defaults to "ng"
  isEpiphanyFixed: false, // optional, tied to countryCode by default
  isAscensionThurs: true, // optional, tied to countryCode by default
);
```

Creates a new instance and initializes the calendar for the given year and country. If no values are passed, it defaults to Nigeria‚Äôs configuration.

### üìÖ `getReadings(DateTime dateTime)`

```dart
final readings = missal.getReadings(DateTime(2024, 12, 25));
```

- **Returns**: A list of `MissalModel` for the given date.
- **Why a list?** Some dates (like major solemnities) may have **multiple masses**, such as vigil and morning masses.

### üåç `updateCountryCode(String newCountryCode)`

```dart
missal.updateCountryCode("us");
```

- Updates the country-specific liturgical calendar configuration.
- Automatically re-initializes the current year using the new country code.

üìå Useful when the same instance is reused for another country without creating a new one.

### üïä `updateLiturgicalSettings({bool? isEpiphanyFixed, bool? isAscensionThurs})`

```dart
missal.updateLiturgicalSettings(isEpiphanyFixed: true, isAscensionThurs: false);
```

- Updates how Epiphany and Ascension are calculated.
- Automatically re-initializes the current year with new values.
- Can be used after changing regions or when the user selects different liturgical settings.

### üß™ Example

Here's how you can use the `MissalCalculation` class to retrieve daily readings:

```dart
import 'package:missal_calculator/missal_calculator.dart';

void main() {
  final missal = MissalCalculation();

  // Fetch readings for Christmas Day
  final christmasReadings = missal.getReadings(DateTime(2025, 12, 25));

  for (var missalModel in christmasReadings) {
    print("üéâ ${missalModel.title} (${missalModel.color.name})");
    for (var reading in missalModel.readings) {
      print("- ${reading.readingType.name}: ${reading.title}");
    }
    print('');
  }
}
```

## üìñ Explanation

### Why a List?

The `getReadings()` method returns a `List<MissalModel>` instead of a single reading because **some liturgical days have multiple celebrations or Mass options**, such as:

- Vigils
- Midnight/Dawn/Day Masses (e.g. Christmas)
- Solemnities or Feasts with alternate readings

Each `MissalModel` in the list represents one full set of readings for that celebration.
