            "Now the serpent was more subtle than any other wild creature that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God say, ‘You shall not eat of "
            "any tree of the garden’?” And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; but God said, ‘You shall not eat "
            "of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’” But the serpent said to the woman, “You "
            "will not die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” So when the woman "

            "this, he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed the man’s eyes with the clay, saying to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Silo′am” "
            "(which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing. The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar, said, “Is not this the "
            "man who used to sit and beg?” Some said, “It is he”; others said, “No, but he is like him.” He said, “I am the man.” They said to him, “Then how "
            "were your eyes opened?” He answered, “The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to Silo′am and wash’; so I went and "
            "washed and received my sight.” They said to him, “Where is he?” He said, “I do not know.” They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly "
            "been blind. Now it was a sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. The Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he "
            "said to them, “He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.” Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not keep the "
            "sabbath.” But others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” There was a division among them. So they again said to the blind man, “What "
            "do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?” He said, “He is a prophet.” The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his "
            "sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight, and asked them, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then "
            "does he now see?” His parents answered, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we "
            "know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself.” His parents said this because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had "
            "already agreed that if any one should confess him to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue. Therefore his parents said, “He is of age, "
            "ask him.” So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, “Give God the praise; we know that this man is a sinner.” "
            "He answered, “Whether he is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I know, that though I was blind, now I see.” They said to him, “What did he do to "
            "you? How did he open your eyes?” He answered them, “I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you too "
            "want to become his disciples?” And they reviled him, saying, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. We know that God has spoken to "
            "Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.” The man answered, “Why, this is a marvel! You do not know where he comes from, and "
            "yet he opened my eyes. We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any one is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him. "
            "Never since the world began has it been heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.” "
            "They answered him, “You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?” And they cast him out. Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having "
            "found him he said, “Do you believe in the Son of man?” He answered, “And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?” Jesus said to him, “You have "
            "seen him, and it is he who speaks to you.” He said, “Lord, I believe”; and he worshiped him. Jesus said, “For judgment I came into this world, that "
            "those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.” Some of the Pharisees near him heard this, and they said to him, “Are we "
            "also blind?” Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, ‘We see,’ your guilt remains.",

            "feet with her hair, whose brother Laz′arus was ill. So the sisters sent to him, saying, “Lord, he whom you love is ill.” But when Jesus heard it he "
            "said, “This illness is not unto death; it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by means of it.” Now Jesus loved Martha and "
            "her sister and Laz′arus. So when he heard that he was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was. Then after this he said to the disciples, "
            "“Let us go into Judea again.” The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?” Jesus "
            "answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. But if any "
            "one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.” Thus he spoke, and then he said to them, “Our friend Laz′arus has fallen asleep, "
            "but I go to awake him out of sleep.” The disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.” Now Jesus had spoken of his death, "
            "but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. Then Jesus told them plainly, “Laz′arus is dead; and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, "
            "so that you may believe. But let us go to him.” Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.” "
            "Now when Jesus came, he found that Laz′arus had already been in the tomb four days. Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off, and many of the Jews "
            "had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary sat in the "
            "house. Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. And even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will "
            "give you.” Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.” "
            "Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and whoever lives and believes in me "
            "shall never die. Do you believe this?” She said to him, “Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, he who is coming into the world.” "
            "When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying quietly, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.” And when she heard it, she rose "
            "quickly and went to him. Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him. When the Jews who were with her "
            "in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. Then Mary, "
            "when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” When Jesus "
            "saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled; and he said, “Where have you laid him?” They "
            "said to him, “Lord, come and see.” Jesus wept. So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!” But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the "
            "blind man have kept this man from dying?” Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb; it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. Jesus said, “Take "
            "away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.” Jesus said "

Roles:
Narrator (N): Proclaims the main narrative.
Jesus (J): Reads the words of Jesus.
Speaker (S): Other individual voices (e.g., Pilate, Peter, servants).

N: One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said,
S: “What will you give me if I deliver him to you?”
N: And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him. Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, 
S: “Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the passover?”
N: He said,
J: “Go into the city to such a one, and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.’”
N: And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the passover. When it was evening, he sat at table with the twelve disciples; and as they were eating, he said,
J: “Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.”
N: And they were very sorrowful, and began to say to him one after another,
S: “Is it I, Lord?”
N: He answered,
J: “He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me, will betray me. The Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”
N: Judas, who betrayed him, said,
S: “Is it I, Master?”
N: He said to him,
J: “You have said so.”
N: Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said,
J: “Take, eat; this is my body.”
N: And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying,
J: “Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”
N: And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus said to them,
J: “You will all fall away because of me this night; for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.”
N: Peter declared to him,
S: “Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.”
N: Jesus said to him,
J: “Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.”
N: Peter said to him,
S: “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.”
N: And so said all the disciples. Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsem′ane, and he said to his disciples,
J: “Sit here, while I go over there and pray.”
N; And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zeb′edee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them,
J: “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.”
N: And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed,
J: “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”
N: And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter,
J: “So, could you not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
N: Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed,
J: “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.”
N: And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words. Then he came to the disciples and said to them,
J: “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.”
N: While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying,
S: “The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him.”
N: And he came up to Jesus at once and said,
S: “Hail, Master!”
N: And he kissed him. Jesus said to him,
J: “Friend, why are you here?”
N: Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear. Then Jesus said to him,
J: “Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?”
N: At that hour Jesus said to the crowds,
J: “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But all this has taken place, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”
N: Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Ca′iaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. But Peter followed him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward and said,
S: “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.’”
N: And the high priest stood up and said,
S: “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?”
N: But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him,
S: “I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.”
N: Jesus said to him,
J: “You have said so. But I tell you, hereafter you wil see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
N: Then the high priest tore his robes, and said,
S: “He has uttered blasphemy. Why do we still need witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy. What is your judgment?”
N: They answered,
S: “He deserves death.”
N: Then they spat in his face, and struck him; and some slapped him, saying,
S: “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?”
N: Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a maid came up to him, and said,
S: “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”
N: But he denied it before them all, saying,
S: “I do not know what you mean.”
N: And when he went out to the porch, another maid saw him, and she said to the bystanders,
S: “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
N: And again he denied it with an oath,
S: “I do not know the man.”
N: After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter,
S: “Certainly you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.”
N: Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear,
S: “I do not know the man.”
N: And immediately the cock crowed. And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus,
J: “Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.”
N: And he went out and wept bitterly. When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death; and they bound him and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor. When Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, saying,
S: “I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.”
N: They said,
S: “What is that to us? See to it yourself.”
N: And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself. But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said,
S: “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money.”
N: So they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
S: “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord directed me.”
N: Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him,
S: “Are you the King of the Jews?”
N: Jesus said to him,
J: “You have said so.”
N: But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer. Then Pilate said to him,
S: “Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?”
N: But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge; so that the governor wondered greatly. Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. And they had then a notorious prisoner, called Barab′bas. So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them,
S: “Whom do you want me to release for you, Barab′bas or Jesus who is called Christ?”
N: For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him,
S: “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much over him today in a dream.”
N: Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barab′bas and destroy Jesus. The governor again said to them,
S: “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?”
N: And they said,
S: “Barab′bas.”
N: Pilate said to them,
S: “Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?”
N: They all said,
S: “Let him be crucified.”
N: And he said,
S: “Why, what evil has he done?”
N: But they shouted all the more,
S: “Let him be crucified.”
N: So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying,
S: “I am innocent of this righteous man’s blood; see to it yourselves.”
N: And all the people answered,
S: “His blood be on us and on our children!”
N: Then he released for them Barab′bas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe upon him, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him they mocked him, saying,
S: “Hail, King of the Jews!”
N: And they spat upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. As they were marching out, they came upon a man of Cyre′ne, Simon by name; this man they compelled to carry his cross. And when they came to a place called Gol′gotha (which means the place of a skull), they offered him wine to drink, mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots; then they sat down and kept watch over him there. And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus the King of the Jews.” Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left. And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying,
S: “You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.”
N: So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,
S: “He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”
N: And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way. Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
J: “Eli, Eli, la′ma sabach-tha′ni?”
N: that is,
J: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
N: And some of the bystanders hearing it said,
S: “This man is calling Eli′jah.”
N: And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink. But the others said,
S: “Wait, let us see whether Eli′jah will come to save him.”
N: And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.

All kneel and pause for a moment in prayer.

N: And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split; the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe, and said,
S: “Truly this was the Son of God!”
N: There were also many women there, looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him; among whom were Mary Mag′dalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zeb′edee. When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathe′a, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed. Mary Mag′dalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb. Next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said,
S: “Sir, we remember how that imposter said, while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last fraud will be worse than the first.”
N: Pilate said to them,
S: “You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.”
N: So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.""",

              "One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said, “What will you give me if I deliver him to you?” And they paid him "
              "thirty pieces of silver. And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him. Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, "
              "saying, “Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the passover?” He said, “Go into the city to such a one, and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, My time "
              "is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.’” And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the passover. "
              "When it was evening, he sat at table with the twelve disciples; and as they were eating, he said, “Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.” And "
              "they were very sorrowful, and began to say to him one after another, “Is it I, Lord?” He answered, “He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me, will "
              "betray me. The Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he "
              "had not been born.” Judas, who betrayed him, said, “Is it I, Master?” He said to him, “You have said so.” Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and "
              "blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.” And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to "
              "them, saying, “Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you I shall "
              "not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.” And when they had sung a hymn, they went out "
              "to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away because of me this night; for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the "
              "sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.” Peter declared to him, “Though they all fall away because "
              "of you, I will never fall away.” Jesus said to him, “Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.” Peter said "
              "to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And so said all the disciples. Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsem′ane, and he "
              "said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I go over there and pray.” And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zeb′edee, he began to be sorrowful and "
              "troubled. Then he said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.” And going a little farther he fell on his face "
              "and prayed, “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.” And he came to the disciples and found "
              "them sleeping; and he said to Peter, “So, could you not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed "
              "is willing, but the flesh is weak.” Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be "
              "done.” And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the "
              "same words. Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man "
              "is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.” While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and "
              "with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one "
              "I shall kiss is the man; seize him.” And he came up to Jesus at once and said, “Hail, Master!” And he kissed him. Jesus said to him, “Friend, why are you "
              "here?” Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, "
              "and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will "
              "perish by the sword. Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then should "
              "the scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?” At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to "
              "capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But all this has taken place, that the scriptures of the prophets might be "

              "see to it yourselves.” And all the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!” Then he released for them Barab′bas, and having scourged "
              "Jesus, delivered him to be crucified. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. "
              "And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe upon him, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling "
              "before him they mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” And they spat upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. And when they had "
              "mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. As they were marching out, they came upon a man "
              "of Cyre′ne, Simon by name; this man they compelled to carry his cross. And when they came to a place called Gol′gotha (which means the place of a skull), "
              "they offered him wine to drink, mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments "
              "among them by casting lots; then they sat down and kept watch over him there. And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus "
              "the King of the Jews.” Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left. And those who passed by derided him, wagging their "
              "heads and saying, “You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.” So also "
              "the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, “He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down "
              "now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’” And the "
              "robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way. Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. And "
              "about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, la′ma sabach-tha′ni?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” And some of the "
              "bystanders hearing it said, “This man is calling Eli′jah.” And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and "
              "gave it to him to drink. But the others said, “Wait, let us see whether Eli′jah will come to save him.” And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded "
              "up his spirit."
              "\n\nAll kneel and pause for a moment in prayer.\n\n"
              "And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split; the tombs also were opened, and "
              "many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared "
              "to many. When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe, and "
              "said, “Truly this was the Son of God!”",

Roles:
Narrator (N): Proclaims the main narrative.
Jesus (J): Reads the words of Jesus.
Speaker (S): Other individual voices (e.g., Pilate, Peter, servants).

N: It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth, and kill him; for they said,
S: “Not during the feast, lest there be a tumult of the people.”
N: And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the jar and poured it over his head. But there were some who said to themselves indignantly,
S: “Why was the ointment thus wasted? For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor.”
N: And they reproached her. But Jesus said,
J: “Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you will, you can do good to them; but you will not always have me. She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burying. And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.”
N: Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them. And when they heard it they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him. And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the passover lamb, his disciples said to him,
S: “Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the passover?”
N: And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them,
J: “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him, and wherever he enters, say to the householder, ‘The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?’ And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us.”
N: And the disciples set out and went to the city, and found it as he had told them; and they prepared the passover. And when it was evening he came with the twelve. And as they were at table eating, Jesus said,
J: “Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.”
N: They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one after another,
S: “Is it I?”
N: He said to them,
J: “It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread in the same dish with me. For the Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”
N: And as they were eating, he took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them, and said,
J: “Take; this is my body.”
N: And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them,
J: “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. Truly, I say to you, I shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”
N: And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. And Jesus said to them,
J: “You will all fall away; for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’ But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.”
N: Peter said to him,
S: “Even though they all fall away, I will not.”
N: And Jesus said to him,
J: “Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.”
N: But he said vehemently,
S: “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.”
N: And they all said the same. And they went to a place which was called Gethsem′ane; and he said to his disciples,
J: “Sit here, while I pray.”
N: And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled. And he said to them,
J: “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch.”
N: And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. And he said,
J: “Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what you will.”
N: And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter,
J: “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
N: And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to answer him. And he came the third time, and said to them,
J: “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.”
N: And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying,
S: “The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away safely.”
N: And when he came, he went up to him at once, and said,
S: “Master!”
N: And he kissed him. And they laid hands on him and seized him. But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear. And Jesus said to them,
J: “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled.”
N: And they all deserted him, and fled. And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body; and they seized him, but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked. And they led Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes were assembled. And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards, and warming himself at the fire. Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but they found none. For many bore false witness against him, and their witness did not agree. And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,
S: “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.’”
N: Yet not even so did their testimony agree. And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,
S: “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?”
N: But he was silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him,
S: “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”
N: And Jesus said,
J: “I am; and you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.”
N: And the high priest tore his clothes, and said,
S: “Why do we still need witnesses? You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?”
N: And they all condemned him as deserving death. And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him, saying to him,
S: “Prophesy!”
N: And the guards received him with blows. And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the high priest came; and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said,
S: “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”
N: But he denied it, saying,
S: “I neither know nor understand what you mean.”
N: And he went out into the gateway. And the maid saw him, and began again to say to the bystanders,
S: “This man is one of them.”
N: But again he denied it. And after a little while again the bystanders said to Peter,
S: “Certainly you are one of them; for you are a Galilean.”
N: But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear,
S: “I do not know this man of whom you speak.”
N: And immediately the cock crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him,
J: “Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.”
N: And he broke down and wept. And as soon as it was morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council held a consultation; and they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him to Pilate. And Pilate asked him,
S: “Are you the King of the Jews?”
N: And he answered him,
J: “You have said so.”
N: And the chief priests accused him of many things.And Pilate again asked him,
S: “Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you.”
N: But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate wondered. Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner whom they asked. And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barab′bas. And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he always did for them. And he answered them,
S: “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?”
N: For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barab′bas instead. And Pilate again said to them,
S: “Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?”
N: And they cried out again,
S: “Crucify him.”
N: And Pilate said to them,
S: “Why, what evil has he done?”
N: But they shouted all the more,
S: “Crucify him.”
N: So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barab′bas; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the praetorium); and they called together the whole battalion. And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on him. And they began to salute him,
S: “Hail, King of the Jews!”
N: And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and they knelt down in homage to him. And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak, and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him. And they compelled a passer-by, Simon of Cyre′ne, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. And they brought him to the place called Gol′gotha (which means the place of a skull). And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh; but he did not take it. And they crucified him, and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take. And it was the third hour, when they crucified him. And the inscription of the charge against him read, “The King of the Jews.” And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left. And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads, and saying,
S: “Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself, and come down from the cross!”
N: So also the chief priests mocked him to one another with the scribes, saying,
S: “He saved others; he cannot save himself. Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.”
N: Those who were crucified with him also reviled him. And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
J: “E′lo-i, E′lo-i, la′ma sabach-tha′ni?”
N: which means,
J: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
N: And some of the bystanders hearing it said,
S: “Behold, he is calling Eli′jah.”
N: And one ran and, filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying,
S: “Wait, let us see whether Eli′jah will come to take him down.”
N: And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed his last.

All kneel and pause for a moment in prayer.

N: And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that he thus breathed his last, he said,
S: “Truly this man was the Son of God!”
N: There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Mag′dalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salo′me, who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him; and also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem. And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, Joseph of Arimathe′a, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph. And he bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. Mary Mag′dalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.""",

              "Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.” Those who were crucified with him also reviled him. And when the sixth hour had come, there "
              "was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, “E′lo-i, E′lo-i, la′ma sabach-tha′ni?” which means, "
              "“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” And some of the bystanders hearing it said, “Behold, he is calling Eli′jah.” And one ran and, filling a sponge full "
              "of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Wait, let us see whether Eli′jah will come to take him down.” And Jesus uttered a loud cry, "

              "of many things.And Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you.” But Jesus made no further answer, so that "
              "Pilate wondered. Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner whom they asked. And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the "
              "insurrection, there was a man called Barab′bas. And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he always did for them. And he answered them, “Do you "
              "want me to release for you the King of the Jews?” For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. But the chief priests "
              "stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barab′bas instead. And Pilate again said to them, “Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King "
              "of the Jews?” And they cried out again, “Crucify him.” And Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him.” "

          text: """In the following passion narrative:
Roles:
Narrator (N): Proclaims the main narrative.
Jesus (J): Reads the words of Jesus.
Speaker (S): Other individual voices (e.g., Pilate, Peter, servants).

N: When the hour came, Jesus sat at table, and the apostles with him. And he said to them,
J: “I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer; for I tell you I shall not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”
N: And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said,
J: “Take this, and divide it among yourselves; for I tell you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”
N: And he took bread, and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them, saying,
J: “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”
N: And likewise the cup after supper, saying,
J: “This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood. But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. For the Son of man goes as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!”
N: And they began to question one another, which of them it was that would do this. A dispute also arose among them, which of them was to be regarded as the greatest. And he said to them,
J: “The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors. But not so with you; rather let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves. For which is the greater, one who sits at table, or one who serves? Is it not the one who sits at table? But I am among you as one who serves. “You are those who have continued with me in my trials; as my Father appointed a kingdom for me, so do I appoint for you that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren.”
N: And he said to him,
S: “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.”
N: He said,
J: I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you three times deny that you know me.”
N: And he said to them,
J: “When I sent you out with no purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?”
N: They said,
S: “Nothing.”
N: He said to them,
J: “But now, let him who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag. And let him who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one. For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, ‘And he was reckoned with transgressors’; for what is written about me has its fulfilment.”
N: And they said,
S: “Look, Lord, here are two swords.”
N: And he said to them,
J: “It is enough.”
N: And he came out, and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him. And when he came to the place he said to them, 
J: “Pray that you may not enter into temptation.”
N: And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and knelt down and prayed,
J: “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but yours, be done.”
N: And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground. And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow, and he said to them,
J: “Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”
N: While he was still speaking, there came a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him; but Jesus said to him,
J: “Judas, would you betray the Son of man with a kiss?”
N: And when those who were about him saw what would follow, they said, 
S: “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”
N: And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear. But Jesus said,
J: “No more of this!” 
N: And he touched his ear and healed him. Then Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders, who had come out against him,
J: “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”
N: Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest’s house. Peter followed at a distance; and when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. Then a maid, seeing him as he sat in the light and gazing at him, said,
S: “This man also was with him.”
N: But he denied it, saying,
S: “Woman, I do not know him.”
N: And a little later some one else saw him and said,
S: “You also are one of them.”
N: But Peter said,
S: “Man, I am not.”
N: And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying,
S: “Certainly this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.”
N: But Peter said,
S: “Man, I do not know what you are saying.”
N: And immediately, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed. And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him,
J: “Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.”
N: And he went out and wept bitterly. Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him; they also blindfolded him and asked him, 
S: “Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?”
N: And they spoke many other words against him, reviling him. When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away to their council, and they said,
S: “If you are the Christ, tell us.”
N: But he said to them,
J: “If I tell you, you will not believe; and if I ask you, you will not answer. But from now on the Son of man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”
N: And they all said,
S: “Are you the Son of God, then?”
N; And he said to them,
J: “You say that I am.”
N: And they said, 
S: “What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.”
N: Then the whole company of them arose, and brought him before Pilate. And they began to accuse him, saying,
S: “We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.”
N: And Pilate asked him,
S: “Are you the King of the Jews?”
N: And he answered him,
S: “You have said so.”
N: And Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes,
S: “I find no crime in this man.”
N: But they were urgent, saying,
S: “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place.”
N: When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. And when he learned that he belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him. So he questioned him at some length; but he made no answer. The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then, arraying him in gorgeous apparel, he sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other. Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, and said to them,
S: “You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him; neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Behold, nothing deserving death has been done by him; I will therefore chastise him and release him.”
N: But they all cried out together,
S: “Away with this man, and release to us Barab′bas”
N: — a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city, and for murder. Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus; but they shouted out,
S: “Crucify, crucify him!”
N: A third time he said to them,
S: “Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death; I will therefore chastise him and release him.”
N: But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed. So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted. He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will. And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyre′ne, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus. And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning to them said,
J: “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed!’ Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us’; and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’ For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?”
N: Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. And when they came to the place which is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left. And Jesus said,
J: “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”
N: And they cast lots to divide his garments. And the people stood by, watching; but the rulers scoffed at him, saying,
S: “He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!”
N: The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him vinegar, and saying,
S: “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”
N: There was also an inscription over him, “This is the King of the Jews.” One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying,
S: “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!”
N: But the other rebuked him, saying,
S: “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.”
N: And he said,
S: “Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingly power.”
N: And he said to him,
J: “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”
N: It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, while the sun’s light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” And having said this he breathed his last.

All kneel and pause for a moment in prayer.

N: Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, and said,
S: “Certainly this man was innocent!”
N: And all the multitudes who assembled to see the sight, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts. And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance and saw these things. Now there was a man named Joseph from the Jewish town of Arimathe′a. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man, who had not consented to their purpose and deed, and he was looking for the kingdom of God. This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud, and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb, where no one had ever yet been laid. It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning. The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid; then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.""",

              "urgent, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place.” When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a "
              "Galilean. And when he learned that he belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. When Herod saw Jesus, "
              "he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him. So he questioned him at some "
              "length; but he made no answer. The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked "
              "him; then, arraying him in gorgeous apparel, he sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had "
              "been at enmity with each other. Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who "
              "was perverting the people; and after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him; neither did Herod, for he "
              "sent him back to us. Behold, nothing deserving death has been done by him; I will therefore chastise him and release him.” But they all cried out together, “Away "
              "with this man, and release to us Barab′bas” — a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city, and for murder. Pilate addressed them "
              "once more, desiring to release Jesus; but they shouted out, “Crucify, crucify him!” A third time he said to them, “Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him "
              "no crime deserving death; I will therefore chastise him and release him.” But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their "
              "voices prevailed. So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted. He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, whom "
              "they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will. And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyre′ne, who was coming in from the country, and laid on "
              "him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus. And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning to "
              "them said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed "
              "are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed!’ Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us’; and to the hills, "
              "‘Cover us.’ For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?” Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with "
              "him. And when they came to the place which is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left. And Jesus said, "
              "“Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.” And they cast lots to divide his garments. And the people stood by, watching; but the rulers scoffed at him, "
              "saying, “He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!” The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him vinegar, and "
              "saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!” There was also an inscription over him, “This is the King of the Jews.” One of the criminals who were "
              "hanged railed at him, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!” But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same "
              "sentence of condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.” And he said, “Jesus, remember "
              "me when you come in your kingly power.” And he said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.” It was now about the sixth hour, and there "
              "was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, while the sun’s light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Then Jesus, crying with a loud "
